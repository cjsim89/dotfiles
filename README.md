# Dotfiles

I use `zsh`, and my handy shortcuts are in this `.zshrc` file. 

My favorites: 
- `setup` for easily setting up a rails project (installs gems, creates, migrates, and seeds db)
- `clopen` for easily cloning, nicknaming, then opening a repository 
- `herokuname` for quickly creating a unique Heroku-type repo name (e.g. 'fast-broccoli-2309')
- `gc` for quickly adding & committing all changes
